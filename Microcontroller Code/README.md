# OpenFlume

This arduino sketch has been tested on a Teensy4.0 development board.
To use this code, follow the wiring diagram from the OpenFlume paper and make all appropriate connections with the Teensy. The Arduino IDE 2.x
has the ability to add additional board manager repositories. Follow the guide found at [PJRC Teensy4.0 Tutorial](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html)
to get the Arduino IDE set up to flash the Teensy. Downlad the flume_controller.ino file and put it in a folder with the name flume_controller. This should allow you to open the arduino project in the IDE, compile, and flash the code.
