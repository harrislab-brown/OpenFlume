# OpenFlume
Low-cost laboratory flume for research and education with full build documentation released under an open hardware license

## Why Build OpenFlume?
OpenFlume offers a 5x5cm flow cross section open channel flow and flow rates between 0 and 50 cm/s. It is as small as it can be while maintaining good uniformity over the test section. It has been fully characterized using Particle
Image Velocimetry. It is designed to be buildable with a range of tool access and skill levels. It uses the minimum viable product for its construction, keeping costs low without sacrificing quality. It is fully documented, so you 
can follow our instructions and build an OpenFlume to suit your needs. 

OpenFlume was designed by members of the Harris Lab and Brown University for experiments related to drag at the interface. To conduct these experiments, the lab needed a well controlled and uniform flow with low surface deviation. 
When looking at the commercial landscape for small scale flumes, the few small scale flumes that were available were expensive and lacked the full characterization needed for the lab to be confident in their applicability to research.
